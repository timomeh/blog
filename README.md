# timomeh.de

This is the source code and the content for my blog, [timomeh.de](https://timomeh.de). It's powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

I hacked this in a few evenings, so don't expect really nice code.

## Prerequisites

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

## Develop

```sh
gatsby develop
```

## Build

```sh
gatsby build
```

Test if afterwards locally with

```sh
gatsby serve
```
